## Quote of the Day 

```
 _________________________________________
/ To a New Yorker, all Californians are   \
| blond, even the blacks. There are, in   |
| fact, whole neighborhoods that are      |
| zoned only for blond people. The only   |
| way to tell the difference between      |
| California and Sweden is that the       |
| Swedes speak better English."           |
|                                         |
| -- From "East vs. West: The War Between |
\ the Coasts                              /
