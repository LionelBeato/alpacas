<!-- ## Lab -->


## Hand in Assignments
>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.

### OPTIONAL: SQL Lab Practice

1. Under SQL should be a section titled "Intro to SQL LAB". 
2. Download all of the material necessary and follow the instructions in the `txt` file.
3. This assignment will be considered optional.

### SQL Project

1. You're going to build a database that mimics some kind of business. What that business does is up to you, but there are some requirements:

    - Your database must have at least three tables
    - Fill each table with at least 15 records
    - Each table should have a set primary key 
    - At least one table in your database should have a foreign key creating a relationship with another table

2. You are able to export SQL files from DataGrip but I recommend uploading whatever works best for you in terms of showing your progress and work. Feel free to take a screenshot if you need to!

## Notes and Links

- [DataGrip, a great tool for SQL(I recommend you download this through JetBrains ToolBox!)](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
- [MariaDB download link](https://downloads.mariadb.org/)
