 _________________________________________
/ What I'd like to see is a prohibition   \
| on Microsoft incorporating              |
| multi-megabyte Easter Eggs and other    |
| stupid bloatware into Windows and       |
| Office. A typical computer with         |
| pre-installed Microsoft shoveware       |
| probably only has about 3 megabytes of  |
| hard drive space free because of flight |
| simulators, pinball games, and          |
| multimedia credits Easter Eggs that     |
| nobody wants. I predict that if         |
| Microsoft is ever forced to remove      |
| these things, the typical user will     |
| actually be able to purchase competing  |
| software now that they have some free   |
| space to put it on. Of course, stock in |
| hard drive companies might plummet...   |
|                                         |
| -- Anonymous Coward, when asked by      |
| Humorix for his reaction                |
|                                         |
\ to the proposed Microsoft two-way split /
