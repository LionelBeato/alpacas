## Homework

### (Optional) Get Started on your Spring Boot App!

1. We went through examples together, but now its time for you to experiment with your own application. Go ahead and follow my lead and create your own spring boot app.
2. This app does not need to be complete, I just want to see at least some progress. Try to have a complete model done.
3. Push your code to GitHub!
4. Keep in mind that this will more than likely be mandatory *next week*!

## Quote of the Day

```
 _________________________________________
/ Love, which is quickly kindled in a     \
| gentle heart,                           |
|                                         |
| seized this one for the fair form       |
|                                         |
| that was taken from me-and the way of   |
| it afficts me still. Love, which        |
| absolves no loved one from loving,      |
|                                         |
| seized me so strongly with delight in   |
| him,                                    |
|                                         |
| that, as you see, it does not leave me  |
| even now. Love brought us to one death. |
