 _________________________________________
/ Love, which is quickly kindled in a     \
| gentle heart,                           |
|                                         |
| seized this one for the fair form       |
|                                         |
| that was taken from me-and the way of   |
| it afficts me still. Love, which        |
| absolves no loved one from loving,      |
|                                         |
| seized me so strongly with delight in   |
| him,                                    |
|                                         |
| that, as you see, it does not leave me  |
| even now. Love brought us to one death. |
